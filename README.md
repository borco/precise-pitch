![icon] Precise Pitch
---------------------

My first Android development experiment, so don't expect anything nice here. It
needs some work to be fully a proper Android app.

Essentially, this is a little instrument tuner and little game to practice your
scales, including feedback.

With `ANDROID_HOME` set to the location of the sdk and
`JAVA_HOME` set to the jdk, connect your debug enabled phone and type:

    ant debug && ant installd

These are the two interesting activities
